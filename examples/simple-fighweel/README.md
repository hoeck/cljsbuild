# Cljsbuild + Figwheel Example

Make sure you have Java, Maven and Nodejs (at least v6.9) installed.
Then fetch the Javascript dependencies by running: `npm install`.

Start the cljs repl with `npm run repl` (takes some time to compile cljs, so be patient).
When `Prompt will show when Figwheel connects to your application` shows up, go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
